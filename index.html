        The enlightening photography exhibition at Camden Image Gallery takes

        favourite prints. With 24 large pictures in a specially-curated gallery
        of photos, each image will be accompanied by a quote from various
        studies about screen use. The phenomenon doesn’t help our wellbeing,
        either, with kids who report being relatively unhappy spending 90
        minutes more on social media than those who reported being happy.

      <p class="description">
        Posing questions like: ‘are we ever truly free from the lure of our
        mobile phone?’ and ‘can we exist happily without technology’, the
        exhibition invites anyone who’d like to reduce their screen time to come
        and take a look at Radu’s eye-opening prints.
